What's BEM

Technology for creating web applications

- CSSO (CSS Optimizer) is a CSS minimizer unlike others.
- SVGO (SVG Optimizer) is a NodeJS-based tool for optimizing SVG vector graphics files.
- borschik is a extendable builder for text-based file formats. It's main purpose is the assembly of static files for web projects (CSS, JS, etc.).
- XJST is a DSL for universal data transformations with compiler written on top of the node.js and ometajs and output code working in any browser or on server-side.
- Naming convention — BEM entities naming rules.

BLOCK

It represents a reusable piece of UI.
Rules: it can contain `[a-z]` and the `-` character.

.block ✔
.my-awesome-block ✔

.camelCaseBlock ✘
.another_block ✘

---

[example]

---

ELEMENT

It is a piece of UI that depends on another one (makes no sense without it).
Rules: it is delimited by a double underscore (__).

.block__element ✔
.login-form__submit ✔
.map__marker ✔

---

[example]

---

MODIFIER

It describes a state of a Block or an Element.
Rules: it is delimited by a single underscore (_).


- Boolean modifiers:

.block_selected ✔
.menu__item_hidden ✔

- Key-value type modifiers:

.list_theme_horizontal ✔
.message_style_important ✔
.message_style_muted ✔

Still unsure what a Block is?

Negative definition:

If (it's an attribute/state of an entity)
	Then it's a Modifier
Else If (it a piece of UI that depends on another)
	Then it's an Element
Else
	It's a good candidate for a Block
	It should be implemented as a reusable piece of UI

Nested blocks? ✔

Nested elements? ✘

Elements cannot be swapped around, removed or added without modifying the existing code.

How to apply modifiers (1):

Always include the default block name in the class (reuse CSS rules)

<div class="menu menu_theme_morning-forest">...</div>  ✔

---

How to apply modifiers (2):

Do not apply the modifier to a parent class!

<body class="app__theme_morning-forest">
	<div class="menu">...</div>
	<div class="message">...</div>
</body>

.app__theme_morning-forest .menu ✘
.app__theme_morning-forest .message ✘

<body>
	<div class="menu menu_theme_morning-forest">...</div>
	<div class="message message_theme_morning-forest">...</div>
</body>

.menu ✔
.message ✔
.menu_theme_morning-forest ✔
.message_theme_morning-forest ✔

+ avoids specifity problems
+ it's faster
- it's verbose
